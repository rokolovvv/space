**This Space Web Page is a visually immersive project dedicated to presenting key information about outer space.**
The page combines multimedia elements and descriptive content to give users an engaging experience as they learn about the vastness and composition of the cosmos. 
Hereâ€™s an overview of its sections and features:

1. **Hero Section**: This section creates an engaging entry with a looping video of stars (`stars.mp4`) that plays in the background, providing a mesmerizing view of space.

2. **Main Section**: This includes a title and an image (`space.jpg`) representing the cosmos.
3. A descriptive paragraph explains what outer space is, covering its low-density matter, electromagnetic radiation, cosmic dust, and particles.
4. The text is informative and rich in details about space's molecular composition and energy.

5. **Video Section**: An embedded YouTube video offers additional context on the nature of space, complemented by a short description.
6. This description further explains the cosmic elements, such as plasma, magnetic fields, and cosmic rays, as well as the temperature

Overall, this project uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling (assumed to be in `style.css`), 
and multimedia elements to create an educational and visually appealing experience about space.
